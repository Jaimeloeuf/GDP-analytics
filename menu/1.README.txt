-This folder contains all txt documents that contains the menu as specified by their names
-The file's formats and setting variables should not be changed / messed with unless you know what you are doing. After editing please save file in the below specified format for the program to be able to use it again.

The files are save with the format (All items needs to be seperated by a whitespace char):

(1)numOflines variable: ...
(2)max_line_length Variable: ... +1 (the line length includes all whitespaces) (its ok to put it higher than it actually is just to be on the safe side of formating)
(3)*Actual menu content

-The words numOflines and max_line_length will not be stored, only a value of integer type will be stored for reading in.
-Variables specified in (1) n (2) will be read in, stored and processed first before the content in the actual menu is read into buffer and printed.
